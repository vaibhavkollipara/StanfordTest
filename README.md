## Installation
Install <a href="https://git-scm.com/downloads">git</a>

Verify the npm installation: 
```
npm -v
```

## With node.js installed
In a directory where you have write permission, clone the repository from Github:

```
git clone git@github.com:ClinGen/react_programming_starter.git
```

When the cloning completes, `cd` into the `react_programming_starter` directory and run the following command:

```
npm install
```
## Start
Start the development task

```
npm start
```

Go to `http://localhost:8080/webpack-dev-server/`

## Test

```
npm test
```

That will run any file ending in `.test.js` in the `src` directory using mocha.
